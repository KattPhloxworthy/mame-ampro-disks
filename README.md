# mame-ampro-disks
This is a repository of disk files for the Ampro Little Board driver for MAME.

Here, you will see some MAME hard disk images created in the sizes of popular Seagate drives of the day in various sizes and geometries.  The model and capacities will
be reflected in the filenames.

When floppy reliability can be better established in MAME's code, I will be uploading floppy images as well.

I will also be uploading some other files used to create the prototype files used to create these images along with info on how to manipulate them.

Other software will be located in my "ampro-bits" repository, which can be used on both real and simulated Ampro Little Board (Plus) systems.
